# CHIP-8 Emulator

## Description

Made in a weekend as a first step in the world of emulation

Based on the [Wikipedia Description](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8#Virtual_machine_description) of the CHIP-8 Virtual Machine and validated against [Timendus' test suite](https://github.com/Timendus/chip8-test-suite)

Using [raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib) as a Graphics, Inputs & Audio backend

## How To

- Build the executable using CMake (for a quick guide see [this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp_questions/comments/1ct28tc/comment/l4ab1wa/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button))
- Run your ROM by either
  - Starting the executable and providing the ROM's path when prompted
  - Passing the ROM's path as a command line argument
- Enjoy

Note: on Windows you can set the executable as the default app for your ROMs or use the "Open With" option in the explorer's context menu
